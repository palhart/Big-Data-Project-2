## Setting up your Python env using uv...

See instructions for setting up uv here: 

https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

Or if you're on Linux / macOS, simply run

```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

And add `~/.cargo/bin` to your `$PATH`.

Then `cd` in the root of this repo and run

```
uv sync
```

This will create an env in `.venv`, which you can activate with

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
